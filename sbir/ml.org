* Machine Learning Pipeline

** Procedure

1. generate zillions of synthetic samples from the theory (Bob's generator)
1. add dispersion and random noise
1. create a data set of synthetic and real samples
1. train a classifier -- the fraud detector -- to distinguish real from synthetic samples
1. adjust the sample generator to defeat as much as possible the fraud detector
1. train a classifier on the synthetic samples that defeat the fraud
   detector. The objective of the classifier is to recognize the phases

** Phase I

1. use the existing QAnalyse data base as a collection of platonic samples
1. mix synthetic samples and add realistic noise
1. train a classifier to identify the phases contained in the samples
1. use QAnalyse to determine the phase proportions
1. test on real data to evaluate performance

** Phase II

1. train the fraud detector and the sample generator (this is the harder part fo the project)
1. retrain the phase classifier
1. evaluate on real data
